My web application is a simple and user-friendly system designed to display information and services. The application includes several pages and sections, as described below:

1. Home Page:

The home page includes sections such as "Home," "Services," and "News." These sections provide important and up-to-date information to the user.



2. Shopping Center:

In the "Shopping Center" section, users can click to navigate to a page where they can view their orders.



3. About Us:

The "About Us" section provides information about the team or services offered by the web application. There is also a link in this section to return to the home page via the "Home" button.
